# KS3021 kit

## Introduction

The KS3021 kit from Keyestudio is a fun kit including IR sensors, LED's and more in all one packet. The main piece, a Raspberry Pi RP2040 controls everything, and uses MicroPython 2.2 as the base. All code for this kit will be located in this folder

Note that these programs require a Raspberry Pi 3+ with an internet connection, and Minicom's serial port.

## Requirements

1 -> Raspberry Pi with internet connection

2 -> Minicom Serial port

3 -> Thonny's programmer editor with interpreter configured

## Configuring interpreter

In Thonny, the default editor does not support the GPIO pins which are required for this project. You will need to go through one of the 5 menus on the top of the screen until you see an option that says configure interpreter. Choose the interpreter as MicroPython(Raspberry Pi Pico) or MicroPython(RP2040 device)
