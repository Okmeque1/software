# Contributing Guidelines

## What is this???

These are the standards for contributing. No more faffing around seeing useless issues not in the correct things. Follow them or i'll be rethinking my life choices

## Issues Guidelines : 

1 -> Do it in the proper section. Don't submit a bug through a "Feature Request" or "Other" issue template.

2 -> Be clear and detailed. Anything, including screenshots, error logs will help to resolve the issues. 

3 -> Don't spam. Already have it in my mailbox.

4 -> If you have a solution for the issue, do a pull request and don't paste a blob of code in the issues.

5 -> Check for duplicates. Imma come back in 2047 and see like 5000 issues that are the same thing.

## Pull Request guidelines : 

1 -> Be clear and detailed about what you changed. This can be line numbers, formats like "print(str(integer_result) + " is the result" -> "print(f"{integer_result} is the result""

2 -> Don't spam. Already have it in my mailbox.

3 -> If you do not have a solution for the issue, do an issue instead of fooling me.

4 -> Test your code. Make sure it ain't terrible. If you're gonna pull request, make sure the code is at least Okmeque1 grade, which is a rather low bar to reach.
